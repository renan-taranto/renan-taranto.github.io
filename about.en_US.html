            I'm a software architect and I guide people, companies, and other organizations to achieve success in their projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2013 }} years of experience, in architecting and implementing quality solutions
            for many different purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            On my <a href="https://github.com/renan-taranto">Github</a> you can find
            <a href="https://github.com/renan-taranto/cqrs-event-sourcing-example">applications</a> that act as examples for
            good solutions.
            I believe that open source software is something amazing and I contributed to the code of projects like
            <a href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> and <a href="https://api-platform.com/">API Platform</a> in the past.
