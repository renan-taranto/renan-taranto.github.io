Hi, my name is [Renan Taranto]({{ site.url }}) and I'm a software architect and engineer.

Professionally, I've been a software developer for more than {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2015 }} years, although my first lines of code were written when I was a kid. Currently, I'm a tech lead at [GESUAS](https://www.gesuas.com.br/).

I've contributed to the code of open source projects like [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) and [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/).

You can follow me on [Github](https://github.com/renan-taranto), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renan-taranto/) and also contact me through my email address: [renantaranto@gmail.com](mailto:renantaranto@gmail.com).
