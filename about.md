Hi, my name is [Renan Taranto]({{ site.url }})!

I'm a software architect and engineer having contributed to the code of open source projects like [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) and [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/).

Professionally, I've been a software developer for more than {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2015 }} years and currently I work at [GESUAS](https://www.gesuas.com.br/) as a tech lead.

You can follow me on [Github](https://github.com/renan-taranto), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renan-taranto/) and also contact me through my email address: [renantaranto@gmail.com](mailto:renantaranto@gmail.com).
